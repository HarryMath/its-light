# its-light

i had to create an app with rooms.
Each user can create a new room by specifying the name and country.
But you can enter a room only if your country matches the country of the room.
Country is determined by ip-address. In each room we can switch light (web-sockets).
In order not to deploy front-end separately, i put page-controller to ther folder with my REST-controllers


deploy: https://its-light.herokuapp.com
